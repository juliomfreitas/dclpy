
DSL written in python for check architectural conformity of python systems..

It's based in simple constraints of interactions between modules defined by system architects.

TODO:
* Implement the ONLY rules
* Think a DSL Syntax
* Improve the way we check whether a class/function belongs to a module. Instead to use an import, we should parse the file and match the names written in it
* Validate the application in a real system
* Log errors in a better way (se the LogEntry classes is good because we can handle reports in a myryad if formats)
