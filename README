
DSL written in python for verify architectural conformity of systems written in Python, based in simple rules of restriction of interactions between modules defined by the architect of the system

TODO:
* Implement the ONLY rules
* Think a DSL Syntax
* Improve the way we check whether a class/function belongs to a module. Instead to use an import, we should parse the file and match the names written in it
* Validate the application in a real system
